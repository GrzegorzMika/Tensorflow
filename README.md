# Tensorflow
Small and not so small deep learning projects done in Tensorflow 2.x

1. Human vs horse - binary image classification (without using tf.keras, playground)
2. Image style transfer using Vgg16 (and not using ..GAN)
3. Oregon wildlife - multiclass image classification (https://www.kaggle.com/virtualdvid/oregon-wildlife)
